# get_next_line
## Get next line : 42 school second project

Final Score: ![Nnevalti's get_next_line Score](https://badge42.herokuapp.com/api/project/vdescham/get_next_line)

**This program** reads a file line by line, and displays it in your **terminal or in another file**.

**To run the program :** `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -D BUFFER_SIZE=10 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c get_next_line.h main.c && ./a.out your_file.txt`

**You can save** the result in another file **by adding** `> ResultFile.txt` at the end of the command above.

**NOTE :**
- BUFFER_SIZE is the number of **MAX** character that will be read every time
- The flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra` aren't necessary to compile
- I'll add a Makefile later (maybe)
